#  💡 Overview 
_Cities Sustainability_ was my final exam for the _Data Visualization_ class during the ML & AI course at ITS Angelo Rizzoli. Note: It was done as a group project.

Based on a series of open datasets found independently online, we had to seek an answer, or at least an overview, of how sustainable European cities were. Sustainability encompassed four themes: environmental, human, social, and economic.
