#  ðŸ’¡ Overview 
Spotify Regression was the final exam of the /Machine Learning Supervised/class. It was done 
as a group project with these other amazing people and coders: Matteo Civita alias Chovo02, 
Mattia Rossini alias MadMatt00, Davide Soltys alias ItsAtlant, Luca Pugno.

The main goal was to predict the popularity of a given song.
The dataset containing the songs information was downloaded through Spotify API.
