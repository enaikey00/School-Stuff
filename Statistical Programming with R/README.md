## 💡 Overview 
The work in question was my final exam for the _Statistical Programming with R_ class while attending the ML & AI course at ITS Angelo Rizzoli. Note: It was done as a group project.

The exam consisted of a data analysis project based on the European Social Survey dataset ([Codebook](file:///Users/miniops/Downloads/ESS-Data-Wizard-subset-2023-05-07%20codebook.html)). Specifically, the task involved selecting a research question, choosing relevant variables, analyzing the data to answer the question (using statistical methods and the R language).

## ⚙️ Features
The project revolves around the question: _“Is having a family important in order to achieve happiness?”_

The hypotheses:
* The importance of family is correlated with happiness.
* The importance of family is correlated with perceived life satisfaction.

Notes:
* The analyzed time period is the year 2018. This is because the other years had too many missing values.

### Project Development
1. Dataset Creation: selection of variables and filtering of observations
2. Data Processing: consistency check, transformations (e.g., recoding of variables)
3. Descriptive Statistics: distribution of variables
4. Hypothesis Testing: statistical analysis
5. Conclusions: results, limitations, further analysis.

## 📂 Project Structure

```bash
repo
├── Report Progetto.Rmd
└── Report Progetto.html

1 directory, 2 files
```

The `.Rmd`file can be opened in R Studio, it shows the R code. The `.html` file can be opened directly in the browser, it shows the output of the R code.

## 🚀 Getting Started
You have 2 options:
1. Using R Studio, open the  `Report Progetto.Rmd` file. This way you can visualise the code and run each code separately.
2. Using a browser, open the  `Report Progetto.html`. This way you can visualise the Report, that’s to say the output of the  `.Rmd` file.
